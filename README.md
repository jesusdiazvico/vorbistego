This is my the code for MSc's thesis: a steganographic system for Vorbis audio 
streams.

It was coded about 10 years ago. I just recalled it and thought of uploading it
here for archival purposes. Use at your own risk.

If I remember correctly, my actual code is mostly inside the _steganos_ folder.

For details, check my MSc thesis "[Steganography and Steganalysis: Data Hiding in Vorbis Audio Streams](http://oa.upm.es/8989/2/TESIS_MASTER_JESUS_DIAZ_VICO.pdf)."
